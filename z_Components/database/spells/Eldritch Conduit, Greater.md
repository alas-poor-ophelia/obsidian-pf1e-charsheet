description: "This spell functions like eldritch conduit save for the differences listed above and that the target must be within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) in order for you to use the conduit. Using a creature as a conduit for a spell ends the greater eldritch conduit effect on that creature, but does not end the effect for other eldritch conduits."
