description: "Rays of light burst forth from your outstretched hand, encircling each target's space with a cage of light. If a target fails its Reflex save, it becomes enclosed in the light prison. A creature enclosed in a light prison can attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally as long as it stays within the light prison. However, if a creature passes through the walls of a light prison enclosing it, it takes 1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round.  Creatures do not receive saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the walls of a light prison surrounding it, the effect ends for that creature."
