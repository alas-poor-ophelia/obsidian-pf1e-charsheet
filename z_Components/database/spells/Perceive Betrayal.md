By concentrating, you can learn the strength of the greatest threat, based on the following categories.  Ill Will: Someone dislikes your liege, but isn't planning to act against her.  Plotting: Someone is actively conspiring against your liege.  Imminent: Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against your liege.  Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by perceive betrayal."
