description: "This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of one normal-sized page per minute.  The Linguistics skill can be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the caster.  You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank pages as required.  The scrivener's chant requires blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material components.  This spell cannot duplicate magical writing (including spells and magical scrolls), though it can duplicate non-magical writing from a magical source."
