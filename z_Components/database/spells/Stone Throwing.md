description: "The subject gains the rock throwing and rock catching abilities (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303). It can use these abilities with any solid, mostly inflexible object with a hardness of at least 5.  The subject can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its own size. The range increment for this attack is 20 feet, and rocks can be hurled a maximum of 5 range increments. Damage is based on the size of the subject-1d8 points of damage for a Large creature, 1d6 for a Medium creature, or 1d4 for a Small creature-plus 1-1/2 times the thrower's Strength bonus.  For every size category smaller than Large the subject is, it receives a cumulative -5 penalty on Reflex saves to catch rocks (or similar projectiles) thrown at it."
