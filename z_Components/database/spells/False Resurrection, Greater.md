description: "This spell functions as false resurrection except that i t calls a belier devil with the young simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 85, 292) to possess the body and all parts of false resurrection that function like resurrection instead function like true resurrection.  Attempts to identify greater false resurrection with a skill check incorrectly identify it as true resurrection (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes greater false resurrection's aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect."
