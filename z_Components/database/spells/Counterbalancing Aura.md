description: "A pulsing bronze glow surrounds the targets, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by neutral creatures, and sickening or nauseating neutral creatures that strike the targets. This abjuration has four effects.  First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. This benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by neutral creatures.  Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 23 against spells cast by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures, and spell resistance 27 against spells cast by neutral creatures with no other alignment components.  Third, the abjuration protects warded creatures from possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does.  Finally, if a chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is sickened for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude negates). If a neutral creature succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is instead nauseated for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude negates)."
