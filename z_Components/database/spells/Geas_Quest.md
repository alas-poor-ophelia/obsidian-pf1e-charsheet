description: "This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.  If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas/quest for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas/quest.  A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do.  Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest."
