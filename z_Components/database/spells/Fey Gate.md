description: "This spell functions similarly to the planar travel function of  gate, except it can be used only to travel between points on the Material Plane and the First World, and comes with additional dangers.  When cast, this spell forms a circular portal between 5 and 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into being (typically vertical and facing you). The portal is full of gray fog that blocks all sight.  Anyone or anything that moves through the portal is shunted instantly to a random point on the First World (the same point for everything traveling via a particular casting). At the end of the spell's duration, the caster can attempt a DC 30 Spellcraft check. On a success, the portal remains open for 1d4+1 days.  While the spell always deposits travelers on solid ground in the First World, it conveys no protections against whatever creatures or environmental hazards may be present there."
