description: "You curse the target with insatiable greed, causing it to attempt to steal any item worth 100 gp or more that it can see, each time it enters a new room or area. If it can see multiple items of value in a single room or area, it attempts to steal the item it thinks is worth the most. This covetous compulsion might cause the target to act recklessly where it normally would not (unless acting in this manner would clearly cause it to die, suffer great harm, or get caught).  In combat, if the target sees a valuable item on an opponent, it must, for example, attempt to disarm its foe to take a valuable weapon or use the steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) to grab a precious item kept on the opponent's belt. Once the target has either attempted to steal an item in combat or else taken damage, this magical compulsion subsides until the threat of the current combat ends and the target enters a new room or area. Affected targets in combat that have neither attempted to steal an item nor taken damage (perhaps because the opponent with the most valuable item is far away) can attempt a saving throw each round to ignore the spell's effect until the threat ends and the target enters a new room.  Break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish can each end covetous urge before the duration expires. Dispel magic does not affect covetous urge."
