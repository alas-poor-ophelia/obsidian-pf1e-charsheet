description: "The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf, opium, pesh, scour, shiver, or zerk. The drug must be used within 1 minute of being conjured or  it dissolves into worthless dust-though the effects of the drug may last far longer. Drugs created by this spell cannot be sold, but they can be given to other creatures. A creature taking the drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly-see each drug's description. The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the creator's caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug. For more information, see Drugs and Addiction on page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.  As a special use of this spell, a worshiper of Mahathallah can create the drug adyton (see sidebar). A Mahathallah worshiper can create only adyton once per week, regardless of her level or how many times she casts this spell. The spell otherwise functions-and creates as many doses-as normal."
