description: "This spell functions like the spell completion option of trap the soul, except it only works on bodiless souls (such as incorporeal undead or a soul trapped in a gem) or creatures whose substance is a physical incarnation of a soul (such as a petitioner), but not on creatures formed from souls and planar material (such as most outsiders). It is mainly used to transfer souls from one receptacle to another, but may also be used to capture vulnerable souls that aren't bound to mortal flesh (such as incorporeal creatures and petitioners)."
