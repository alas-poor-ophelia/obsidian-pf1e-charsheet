description: "When casting this spell, you must plant the material components in soil. When you do, at the end of casting, a large beanstalk rises up from the ground. It's strong enough to support Huge or smaller creatures weighing no more than 2,000 pounds total, and has enough handholds and footholds that it can be climbed as if it were knotted rope (Climb DC 5). At the end of the spell's duration, the beanstalk withers and dies at an accelerated rate, leaving nothing more than a pile of compost."
