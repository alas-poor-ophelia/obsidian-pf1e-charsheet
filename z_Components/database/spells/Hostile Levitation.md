description: "You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target's speed. The target also takes a -4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.  This spell fails if cast on a flying creature."
