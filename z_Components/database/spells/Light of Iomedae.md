description: "With this spell, you create shafts of blue light that illuminate all undead creatures in the area. Affected undead take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but the light does make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such undead are located (they still retain the 50% miss chance granted by invisibility).  The light of Iomedae increases light levels by one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature. Once an undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the spell's range, even if it leaves the spell's original radius, until the spell's duration ends.  Affected undead must also make a Will save when they are first illuminated by the light of Iomedae. Those who fail this save lose all benefits of channel resistance and take a -2 penalty on all saving throws made against positive energy effects."
