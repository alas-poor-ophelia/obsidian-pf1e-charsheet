description: "Your teeth extend and sharpen, transforming your mouth into a maw of razor-sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit with this attack, it also deals 1 point of bleed damage. If you already have a bite attack, your bite deals 2 points of bleed damage on a critical hit. You are considered proficient with this attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus -5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage.  You can end this spell before its normal duration by making a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar."
