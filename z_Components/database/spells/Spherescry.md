description: "This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously consumed some portion of the spellcaster's body: a single digit of a finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true scrying spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere, but spherescry produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be discovered by normal methods of magical detection."
