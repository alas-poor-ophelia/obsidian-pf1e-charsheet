description: "A saddle affected by this spell becomes more comfortable to sit in, and the magic stabilizes any shaking motion caused by riding at a high speed. For the duration of the spell, the penalty to use ranged weapons while mounted in the target saddle decreases by 2. This stacks with the benefit of the Mounted Archery feat and similar effects. Furthermore, the DC for any concentration check required as a result of the mount's movement decreases by 2."
