description: "You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area. Even nonliving creatures, such as constructs or undead, wither in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage taken and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; any plant creatures caught in the burst are staggered for 1d4 rounds even on a successful saving throw."
