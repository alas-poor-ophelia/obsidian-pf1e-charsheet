description: "A rushing stream of fire sprays from your outstretched hand, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. Each round you continue to concentrate on the spell, you can select a new area for it to affect.  Firestream sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the firestream may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does."
