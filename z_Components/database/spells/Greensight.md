description: "Upon casting this spell, the recipient is empowered to see up to 60 feet through thick plant matter as though it were transparent.  Leaves, vines, and greenery-even moss, lichen, and slime- offer no concealment to the recipient's sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, as if from trees or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a recipient of the effects of greensight."
