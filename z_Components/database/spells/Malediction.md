description: "You utter a dire curse over the body of a dying creature, allowing you to consume its waning life force. Upon this spell, you touch a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. If the target fails its saving throw, it dies and you gain 1 hero point for every 5 Hit Dice possessed by the target (minimum 1, maximum 3). These hero points last for a number of minutes equal to the target's Hit Dice. Any hero points remaining when this spell ends are lost."
