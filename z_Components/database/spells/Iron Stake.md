description: "This spell creates a foot-long spike of cold iron that you fling at your target as a ranged touch attack. The stake is treated as a magic cold iron weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, and deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 caster levels you have.  Additionally, if a creature with DR/cold iron takes damage from this spell, it is sickened for 1 round, and must attempt a Fortitude save. If it fails, for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, it must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any normally required concentration checks) to use any of its spells or spell-like abilities-the DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's level. If the creature fails the check, its spell is wasted."
