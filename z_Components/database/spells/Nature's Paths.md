description: "The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the target treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road, and any terrain with a road or trail as though there were a highway (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 171-172). Up to one creature per caster level traveling with the target can also benefit from the effect. The spell functions only outdoors and does not function in magically altered terrain."
