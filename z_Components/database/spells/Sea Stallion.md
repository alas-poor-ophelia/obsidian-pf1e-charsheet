description: "This spell functions as sea steed, but as long as you are mounted on the affected creature, you also gain the amphibious quality and your melee attacks function as if you were using freedom of movement. If you are dismounted, you retain the amphibious quality for 1 minute; if you remount before this time, the spell continues. If not, your mount retains the effects but you do not. If your mount is dropped to 0 or fewer hit points, the spell ends for both of you."
