Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below.   Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 1 snake.   Constrictor Snake: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.   Advanced Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood.
