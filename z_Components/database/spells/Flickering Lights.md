description: "You cause the illumination in the area to seem to flicker erratically, fluctuating between absolute darkness and blinding brightness.

Bright light affects creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity. For the purpose of superseding its effects with higher-level light or darkness spells, flickering lights counts as a light spell when it increases the ambient light level and a darkness spell when it decreases the ambient light level."
