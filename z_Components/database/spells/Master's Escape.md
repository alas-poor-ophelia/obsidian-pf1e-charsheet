After casting master's escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature's space as a swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before you can use this spell's effect, you can teleport to a space that you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell."
