description: "Drawing upon positive energy, you emulate some of a paladin's power to smite undead. Choose one undead creature as your target.  Your melee attacks against that target gain a bonus equal to your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher, on your attack rolls, and a bonus equal to your caster level on damage rolls. Your melee attacks also bypass the target's damage reduction. These bonuses do not stack with the bonuses from a paladin's smite."
