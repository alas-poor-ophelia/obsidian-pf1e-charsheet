description: "Drawing on the essence of astradaemons, your hands elongate and sprout fearsome, translucent claws that radiate a cold phosphorescent light, giving you two claw attacks per round (1d6 each if you are Medium creature, or 1d4 if you are Small). Each hit with a claw bestows 1 negative level on your target, and you gain 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. The DC to overcome these negative levels is equal to the DC of this spell. The claws do not interfere with your ability to cast spells or perform other actions that require hands."
