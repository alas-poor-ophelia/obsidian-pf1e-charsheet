description: "A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weapon's wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target. If the creature successfully resists umbral weapon, the spell is dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal."
