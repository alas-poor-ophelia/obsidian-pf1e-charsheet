description: "This spell functions like remove radioactivity, save that it cures all ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that the target has taken. In addition, you can deplete a radioactive object as well, although because you must touch the object to affect it, you expose yourself to at least 1 round of contact with the object's radiation. You must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + the Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect) in order to deplete the object. If you are successful, the object no longer emits radiation. In the case of a nuclear reactor or atomic warhead, this permanently renders the reactor or warhead inert and harmless."
