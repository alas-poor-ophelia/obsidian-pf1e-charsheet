description: "You infuse arcane power into the focus ioun stone, which must be currently floating around your head. If the ioun stone ever ceases floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the ioun stone in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a dull gray ioun stone). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a dull gray ioun stone and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time."
